<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I was born on November 20, 1995 in Izmir, Turkey. My mother was a civil servant and was assigned to Ankara, the capital of Turkey.
  Therefore, we moved to Ankara with the whole family. I studied at many different primary schools. I educated myself culturally during high school.
  I graduated from Gazi University, Department of Political Science and Public Administrationin 2017. I was appointed as an assistant specialist at Eximbank in 2018.
  After a tiring thesis process in order to be promoted to specialist, I was promoted and became a specialist in 2021. 
  I graduated from Gazi University Informatics Institute in 2024 with a master's degree in Management Information Systems. 
  After a tiring work process, I was promoted and became a senior specialist. Currently, I am improving myself in different areas.
